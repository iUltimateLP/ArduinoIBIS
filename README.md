# ArduinoIBIS

âš¡ Implementation of the VDV 300 IBIS Wagenbus protocol for Arduino and Arduino-core based devices ðŸ’¡

## Introduction
This open-source project aims to be an *Arduino* library that maintains communication with various public transport equipment, such as screens, displays, announcement devices or ticket printers. The term **IBIS** is german and stands for "**I**ntegriertes **B**ord**I**nformations**S**ystem" (eng.: "integrated board information system"). It is defined by the VDV and it's definition as well as it's extensions are nowadays available for reading on the [VDV's knowhow page](https://knowhow.vdv.de/documents/300/).

**IBIS** was designed back in 1992, but it is still widely used to this day, in old and new installations.

## How does IBIS work?
To it's core, **IBIS** is just a plain-standard RS232/TTL serial signal, communicating with a baud rate of *1200*, *7* data bits, *equal* parity and *2* stop bits (`1200 7E2`). The difference to a standard serial signal lies in the voltage levels. While a TTL signal operates between 0V and 3.3V, **IBIS** is inverted and amplified to a *24V* level. Driving a higher voltage makes the data transmission more robust in harsh environments like trains and buses, and also allows to run longer data lines.

**IBIS** is bidirectional, meaning that devices and both send and receive data to/from the bus. Usually, the **IBIS** controller in a vehicle is located near the driver's seat and receives input from the driver or over the air, generates **IBIS** data and sends it to every piece of equipment installed. Those devices can then decide whether they want to react to the sent data, or not.

**IBIS** speaks *telegrams*. All of those telegrams are defined in the [VDV 300 document, page 41 following](https://knowhow.vdv.de/documents/300/). Each of those telegrams has a consecutive number (e.g. `001`, also often refered to as `DS001`) and a specific coding which defines the structure of the telegram's payload.

Due to the higher voltage levels (24V), connecting an **IBIS** device directly to a microcontroller is **NOT** possible. At the very least, you'll need a strong transistor that is triggered from the Arduino and switches a 24V power supply to the **IBIS** port.

> ðŸ’¡ Together with this library, I've created an [open-source **IBIS** controller utilizing an ESP8266 (Wemos D1)](https://github.com/iUltimateLP/IBIS_WiFi_Controller). You can build the controller yourself, and then use this library to interface with your **IBIS** devices.

## Getting started
Once you've built the hardware side of things, the **IBIS** communication can be established with only a few lines of code:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ArduinoIBIS.h>

int txPin = 12;
int rxPin = 13;
ArduinoIBIS::Port ibis;

void setup()
{
	  ibis.Begin(txPin, rxPin);
}

void loop()
{
	  ibis.DS003c("Hello World!");
	  delay(3000);
	  ibis.DS003c("I'm ArduinoIBIS!");
	  delay(3000);
	  ibis.DS003c("Nice to meet you!");
	  delay(3000);
}
```

This example begins the **IBIS** communication on the given transmit and receive pins (all pins supported by [ESPSoftwareSerial](https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial) are supported here), and then periodically sends the `DS003c` telegram to the connected display.

## Credits
This library wouldn't've been possible without the efforts of the following projects and people. Thanks to:
 - [plerup/ESPSoftwareSerial](https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial), which is used as the serial communication library
 - [CatoLynx](https://github.com/CatoLynx), who helped me debugging my hardware and software since day one (I've also taken his awesome [pyFis](https://github.com/CatoLynx/pyFIS/blob/master/pyfis/ibis/ibis_protocol.py) protocol as a reference)
 - various public transport companies who provided me with tech throughout the years
